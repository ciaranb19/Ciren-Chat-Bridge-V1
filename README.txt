A chat-bridge for Minecraft servers. Made for 1.8

This is my chat bridge for my own 1.8.1 server. It can probably work for future versions but I haven't tested it yet. This is my first "big" project I've done with coding so don't expect it to be a masterpiece. Any bugs or issues let me know and I'll try my best to fix them.

HOW TO USE:

1.Set up your discord bot, there's tons of tutorials watch one and remember to copy your Discord Token.

2.Write your RCON password and Discord Token into the .env file.

3.Write your server IP, server port, discord channel id [this will be where you want your messages to go to] and your latest log and stats directory[ITS CRUCIAL YOU PUT *.json AT THE END!!!] both of these files will be in your server folder.

4.Start the main.py script and start your server.

5.Test it out :D
